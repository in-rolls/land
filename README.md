### Unlanded: Distribution of Land in Bihar

Bihar, the third largest state in India, with over 100M people, is also its poorest---the GDP ppp is a mere $630. Agriculture constitues 23% of the economy which makes land ownership a vital source of income for many people. 

Using the Bihar land records data---plot-level land records (N= 41.87 million plots or 12.13 individuals/accounts across 35,626 villages)---we describe the distribution of ownership of land, and how ownership varies by caste, religion, and gender. We also show ownership by last name and list top 10 land owning first and last names.

In particular, we investigate the distribution of a) the number of plots and b) total land area by `account number`. We also check how the ownership of land is distributed across castes and religion and using [naampy](https://github.com/appeler/naampy), we infer what proportion of land is registered to women. We compare these to the [base distribution](data/guesstimates.md).
